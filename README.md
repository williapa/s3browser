# s3browser
file browser s3 node app 
uses npm 'aws-sdk'

adapted from http://tutorialzine.com/2014/09/cute-file-browser-jquery-ajax-php

This project is a great starting point as a file browser. I have modified the php to node, somewhat modified the jquery and html, and changed the css color and display style to use flex, which I prefer.

current features:

enter name of public bucket, press enter to view

you now view the items(files) and buckets(folders) within that bucket.

Express is used in the server because it will eventually need to build an html response.
